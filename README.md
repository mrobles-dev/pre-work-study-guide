# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

- In search of a greater calling, I am learning to code
- I built this project as direct start into coding with easily acquirable notes
- The problem this solves for me is having the notes in a website
- The most important thing I learned was how to use VS Code for the construction of the site as well as getting familiar with Git and GitHub
